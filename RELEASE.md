# Release History

*****************

## Release ONDEWO Survey Nodejs Client 2.0.2

### Improvements

* [[OND211-2443]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND211-2443) New TLS / mutual TLS helper `auth/grpcChannel`, exported from the package root: `GrpcClientConfig`, `createChannelCredentials` and `createGrpcClient` build `@grpc/grpc-js` credentials and channel options from PEM **content** (`grpcCert`, `grpcClientCert`, `grpcClientKey`), never a file path. An empty `grpcCert` trusts the system roots. Same contract as the Python SDKs (ondewo-client-utils 4.1.x).
* [[OND211-2443]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND211-2443) Refused before gRPC sees them: half a client identity (certificate without key or key without certificate), a value that is not PEM content (e.g. a path), and `useSecureChannel: false` together with a client identity. Empty strings on both mean plain TLS. Error messages name the field and `host:port`, never a PEM, a key or the config object.
* [[OND211-2443]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND211-2443) A plaintext channel logs a warning naming `host:port`; bare IPv6 hosts are bracketed (`[::1]:50051`); CRLF PEMs work; the client key renders as `***REDACTED***` in `toString`, `util.inspect` and `JSON.stringify`.
* [[OND211-2443]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND211-2443) Channel defaults: max message length `2**31 - 1` in both directions, `grpc.max_reconnect_backoff_ms` 5000, `grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms` 20000, `grpc.keepalive_permit_without_calls` 0. `grpc.keepalive_time_ms` is deliberately left unset: grpc-js has no `grpc.http2.max_pings_without_data`, so keepalive pings on a silent stream make a grpc-core server answer GOAWAY `too_many_pings`.
* [[OND211-2443]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND211-2443) README section "TLS, mutual TLS and certificates": modes, loading PEMs from files, a test PKI with openssl, security notes and troubleshooting.
* [[OND211-2443]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND211-2443) Tests: real handshakes against an in-process grpc-js server with an openssl test PKI generated at test time (TLS, mutual TLS, missing or foreign client identity rejected, wrong CA, CRLF PEMs, IPv6 where available), plus the refusal and redaction cases. CI runs on Node 20, 22 and 24 with `npm ci`, and fails when the committed `auth/` build output drifts from its source.

### Bug Fixes

* [[OND211-2443]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND211-2443) Regenerated with ondewo-proto-compiler 5.15.5: `public-api.js` (the package `main`) is now a CommonJS barrel, so `require('@ondewo/survey-client-nodejs')` works. With earlier compilers it contained `export * from` lines and failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. CI now `require()`s the package root. The missing `google/api/experimental/authorization_config` stubs are generated.
* [[OND211-2443]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND211-2443) The committed `auth/offlineTokenProvider.js` / `.d.ts` had been compiled from an older revision with an older target; they are rebuilt from the current source.
* [[OND211-2443]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND211-2443) `tests/releaseNotes.spec.ts` pins the release-notes slice: every heading's spelling, every section's `*****` separator, `src/RELEASE.md` == `RELEASE.md` and non-empty notes for the current version.

API unchanged: built from the same [ondewo-survey-api](https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-survey-api) commit as 2.0.1 (`37d2f92`, branch `OND211-2418-add-keycloak-for-2-fa`).

*****************

## Release ONDEWO Survey Nodejs Client 2.0.1

### Bug Fixes

* [[OND221-2830]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND221-2830) Regenerated with [ondewo-proto-compiler 5.13.0](https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-proto-compiler/releases/tag/5.13.0).
* [[OND221-2830]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND221-2830) The hand-written `auth/` surface is now re-exported from the generated public-api barrel. It was compiled and shipped inside the package but nothing re-exported it, so importing a symbol from the package root did not resolve and consumers could only deep-import the module. The re-export is emitted by the compiler, so it survives the regeneration that rewrites the barrel on every build.
* [[OND221-2830]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND221-2830) Tooling: `conventional-pre-commit` now runs before `giticket` at the commit-msg stage - with giticket first, its `[OND221-2830] fix: ...` rewrite was no longer valid Conventional Commits and every commit on a ticket branch failed. `README.md` is prettier-ignored where `.prettierrc` sets `useTabs` and markdownlint's MD010 de-tabs the same blocks, and the codegen `docker run` invocations no longer pass `-it`, which fails outside a TTY.
